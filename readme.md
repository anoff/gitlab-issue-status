Since `node-canvas` and underlying modules currently have [issues](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/760) with emojis they are loaded as png images into the canvas image.

### Cache policy

By default the images have a cache age of `30 seconds` which should keep load off the server but still offer near _realtime_ updates of issue states.
